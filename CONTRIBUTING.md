# Contributing Guidelines
Thank you for your interest in contributing a report to MAME!

When reporting a bug, please fill out the information in the template, as it helps reduce reporting issues already known.

## Q&A
- **Q**: Why shouldn’t I report a bug for machines that say “_THIS MACHINE DOESN’T WORK_”, ”_there are known problems with this machine_”, or “_imperfectly emulated features: [aspect]_”?
  - **A**: If one of these show up, we already know the machine in question does not correctly work or emulate the aspect you are reporting a bug on.

    MAME is a big and ambitious project and we all want to see MAME accurately emulate the machines we’re interested in (as well as the ones we’re not so interested in!). Many want to see their machine of interest fully emulated. Please be patient, we’re working on it!
  
    If you can give any technical information as to how we could emulate your machine in question better, however, we would welcome a report!
   
- **Q**: If my issue is for a machine that is listed as “NOT WORKING”, but the aspect I’m reporting an issue on is listed as "OK" (e.g. graphics), should I report it?
  - **A**: ???

- **Q**: The machine I’m trying to play is slow, should I report a bug for this?
  - **A**: See [the performance FAQ](https://wiki.mamedev.org/index.php/FAQ:Performance) on the main website.
