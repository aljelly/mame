I have checked that the machine/game I am running does not show the following when I load it (see the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) as to why you need to check for these):
  - [ ] A red banner saying “_THIS MACHINE DOESN'T WORK_”
  - [ ] A banner saying “_there are known problems with this machine_”
  - [ ] A banner describing the aspect I am reporting an issue with as “_imperfectly emulated_”
        (e.g. you are reporting an issue with the sound when the machine/game shows “imperfectly emulated: sound”)

## System information (please fill out)
  - OS: [Windows/macOS/GNU+Linux/something else]
  - MAME version: [e.g. 0.217, launch MAME and look at the top to find the version]
  - Romset name of machine or software: [e.g. `pacman` or `saturn sonicru`]
